### Introduction

Compared to the extensive awareness of pathological determinants of health, the amount of public knowledge on Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) is insufficient, if not meager. SDOH are conditions in the places where people live, learn, and play that affect a wide range of health and quality-of life-risks and outcomes.  Although these determinants may not be observed directly, their pervasiveness in peopleâ€™s lives should not be overlooked, given that 60% of what creates health has to do with the interplay between socio-economic and community environments and lifestyle behaviors. Among these conditions, transportation challenges undoubtedly play an important role. In fact, research shows that there are 3.6 million Americans who do not obtain medical care due to transportation barriers . From the Medicare-provider perspective, such challenges also have a negative impact given that it incurs a $150 million cost of missed appointment to the industry.

If transportation challenges have been a dilemma that patients could handle using ad-hoc methods including public transportation or ride-share services over the years, the recent COVID-19 pandemic assuredly worsened the problem. With limited public transportation means available and a fatal virus spreading across the world, patients are being forced to make a difficult decision between risking infection going to the medical appointment or staying home but leaving symptoms untreated. Thus, we face an unprecedented urgency to quickly and accurately identify people who are at risks of transportation challenges. And then we need to develop a feasible plan to remove the social determinant barriers for high risk people, so that they can receive quality healthcare.

### Methods Used
* KNN Missing Value Imputation
* Principal Component Analysis
* Logistic Regression
* Random forest
* XGBoost

### Technologies
* R for preliminary data inspection
* Interactive Python in Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas and Numpy for feature extraction
* Scikit-learn for feature engineering and model development
* Matplotlib for data visualization
* Amazon Web Services (AWS) for hyperparameter tuning
* Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for AutoML
* Excel for data exportation


### Project Goal
Our goal is to find the best model with the most important features to predict the probability of each Medicare member experiencing transportation challenges. Therefore, we aimed to find a model with the highest AUC score, as it provides an aggregate measure of performance across all possible classification thresholds.
